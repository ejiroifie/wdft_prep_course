/* 
Write your explanation for Exercise #1 here
First we declare the variable
Next we create the for loop, the for loop declares a variable with a starting value (var i = 0)
It then evaluates a condition which starts from 0 to 6
all the code inside the for loop is run line by line, and the value of i increase by 1
the condition is checked again and if its still true, another number will print out
The number gets to 6 and it stops

// Write your solution below


function isEven(num) 
{
  if (num%2 == 0)
  console.log('The number is even');
else
 console.log('The number is odd');
}



/* 
Write your explanation for Exercise #2 here
    declare the function,inside the function we use an if statement for two conditions to be met
    if there tend to be no remainder then we know num is even else num will be oddd
